This project is an application that tracks the location and quality water sources meant to be used by nonprofit organizations.

This semester-long project was created for the Georgia Tech CS 2340 (Objects and Design) class as a way of showing our knowledge of Agile development, product design and implementation. It is not meant to be used officially in production.
All team members contributed to the codebase, but we also had individual team responsibilities.

Team members:
Emily Huskins (Product Manager)
Forrest Bengston (Quality Assurance)
Nic Alton (Designer/Analyst)
Jack Winski (Tool Smith)
Scott Simmons (System Integrator)

How we did it:
The overall project is a Java application. We used JavaFX to implement the UI.
We integrated the Google Maps API to give a graphical representation of the water source locations.

***** work in progress, will add more information ******
